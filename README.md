# Cheer Up! A web app for finding cute images.

This is a short and sweet web app that gets thumbnail images from reddit.com/r/aww, displays them on the screen, and includes a search function for when you're in the mood for something sweet and specific.

It uses React and is hosted on Netlify [here](https://keen-wright-af9e6f.netlify.app/).


## Usage

You can use Cheer Up like Google Images, except results will be limited to only adorable things --so in a way, it's preferable to Google--.
